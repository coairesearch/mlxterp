# Example Data

This directory contains example data files used by the examples.

## Files

- **sae_layer23_mlp_10000samples_evaluation.json** - SAE evaluation results from training on 10,000 samples

## Usage

These data files are referenced by example scripts in the parent `examples/` directory. They demonstrate typical outputs and can be used to test visualization and analysis tools without running full training runs.

## Adding New Data

If you create new example data:
1. Keep files small (< 10MB preferred)
2. Use descriptive filenames
3. Document the file contents here
4. Consider adding to `.gitignore` if files are large
