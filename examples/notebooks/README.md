# Example Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating mlxterp features.

## Notebooks

- **Test Library.ipynb** - Interactive testing and demonstration of mlxterp features

## Usage

Start Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Or use Jupyter Lab:
```bash
jupyter lab
```

Then open any notebook in this directory.

## Creating New Notebooks

When creating example notebooks:
1. Use clear section headers and markdown explanations
2. Include imports and setup in the first cell
3. Add comments explaining each step
4. Clear output before committing (unless the output is important to show)
5. Keep notebooks focused on one feature or workflow

## Note

Notebooks are great for interactive exploration but scripts (in `examples/*.py`) are better for:
- Reproducible examples
- CI/CD testing
- Quick reference of API usage
